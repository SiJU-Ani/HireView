## How Our AI Works

Job-Wise integrates artificial intelligence throughout the recruiting process:

**Resume Analysis**
Our natural language processing models evaluate resumes and candidate inputs against your specific job requirements, identifying both obvious matches and hidden potential.

The platform learns from your hiring decisions and feedback, becoming more accurate at identifying candidates who succeed in your organization.
